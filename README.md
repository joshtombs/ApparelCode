ApparelCode
===========

### To Clone Repo
- Register SSH Keys with Github
- `git clone` + url from right side of repo

### Using:
- Sublime Text
- Ruby version 2.1.1
- Rails version 4.1.1
- PostgresQL 9.3.4

### Github
- Please don't push anything to master, all features should be done on a new branch, and then PR'd.
- Commits should be rebased to avoid a crazy github history

### Sublime Text
- Please use 2 space indentation (where tabs use spaces)
- If your sublime doesn't already have this  setting add this to sublime config ` ensure_newline_at_eof_on_save `
